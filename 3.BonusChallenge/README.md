Do not work on this challenge unless you have completed 1.DoThisFirst and 2.ThenDoThis

This is a bonus challenge and is NOT required.  This is just an opportunity for you to showcase your skills in other areas besides C#.

We will use the Chrome browser to test this - you don't need to support any other browsers.

What you need to do (at a minimum):

	Add code to this project so that it meets the following minimum requirements:

		- has code that processes a list of strings using the requirements found in the 2.ThenDoThis project that you should have already completed.

		- has at least one model that is used to display the results

		- has at least one controller with the following:

			- has a route that will process the Resources.SimpleList array
				- should return an object with the results of processing the Resources.SimpleList array 
				- has a link in the main navigation bar

			- has a route that will process the Resources.HarderList array
				- should return an object with the results of processing the Resources.HarderList
				- has a link in the main navigation bar		

			- has a view that displays the model with the results.  
				- should use the _layout.cshtml file
				- should display the list of lists in the same fashion and using the same requiremnts found in the 2.ThenDoThis project - feel free to style this with CSS as you see fit
				- you can do final sorting here using Razor or javascript/jquery if you want

You can add whatever methods and new classes you need.  Feel free to use this as an opportunity to showcase your skill in writing clean, readable, reusable code

Demonstrating your skills with SOLID principles is a huge plus!

Feel free to copy in your code from 2.ThenDoThis to get started, because this challenge is not about the sorting - you already did that.  
Rather, this challenge is about showing us your skills in working with an MVC project

There is no expectation or requirement as to how the UI should look - completely up to you.

You can accomplish this in many ways - we leave that up to you.  Show us your ideas!

If you have time, feel free to add behaviors to the view to make it more functional (like sorting) and to demonstrate your skills with client-side code

Also feel free to tweak the css to make it look the way you want - show us your ideas on how a clean, professional web page should look!

You can also add/remove/modify any of the code that is present to make the site look or behave the way you want.  This is your chance to shine!
