## Intro

This solution was created in Visual Studio 2022 on a Windows PC.  

You should be able to use VS 2022 Community (free version) to complete the work.

Older versions of Visual Studio are not advised.

The projects in the solution are ordered by difficulty.

We expect and trust you to do this work yourself. 

Questions are welcome and expected.

Ideally, we want this done before the technical interview, so we can address any questions that come up.  

The intent behind these tasks is to provide you with different levels of difficulty where you can showcase your skills, experience, and style.

This is not scored, and we may or may not discuss it during the interview.  We just use it to get to know you within the context of some code.


## Assignments

### 1.DoThisFirst

- The Program.cs file contains a comments section that describe what we expect.
- This is a very easy exercise that should be something you can do in less than an hour.
- Obviously, do this one first.

### 2.DoThisNext
- Again, the Program.cs file contains a comments section that describes what we expect.
- This project is more challenging, but should be something you can do in a few hours.
- Please make sure you read the requirements in the comments section.
- Ask questions if you need clarification.

### 3.BonusChallenge
- This has a readme file at the root of the project with further instructions and requirements.  
- This is a more difficult challenge - as such, it is optional.
- It was done in .Net framework, but if you want to change to .Net Core, that is fine also.
- Feel free to submit a partially complete project - as long it compiles and can be stepped through in the debugger, it is fine.



## How to complete the homework

- Clone this into a repository on your GitHub account
- Do the assignments and commit/push to your public repository (make sure its public!)
- Send us the url to clone your repo

## After the interview
- Feel free to delete your clone (or do with it what you wish)
